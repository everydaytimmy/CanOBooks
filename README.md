**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations
#### Logistical
We will be available/ communicate from 1 - 6 pm (PST)
We will communicte through Slack
Breaks will be taken as needed. Once an hour sounds reasonable
If we fall behind we will utilize TAs

#### Cooperative
Strenghts: Tim V: Leadership. Fashion. - Tim E: Communication. Style.
By maintaining open dialoge and collaboration (see strengths above) we should have no major issues completing this work.
We hope to strenghen our Javascript skill with this product. 
We will have brief standups each day before starting the lab.

#### Conflict Resolution
If one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing then the workhorse person will commission a hit on the sandbagger.
Alternatively if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute then that would be kinda weird. We can also tattle.
How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? - Fire communication skills - see above.
